
Sure, I can guide you through deploying files to GitHub using Git Bash. Here are the steps:

Install Git Bash: If you haven't already installed Git Bash, you can download and install it from the official website: Git Bash Download.
Set Up Git: Once Git Bash is installed, open it and configure your username and email using the following commands. Replace YourName with your GitHub username and youremail@example.com with the email associated with your GitHub account.
arduino
Copy code
git config --global user.name "YourName"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
Initialize Git Repository: Navigate to the directory where your project files are located using the cd command. Then, initialize a new Git repository using the following command:
csharp
Copy code
git init
Add Files: Add the files you want to deploy to the repository using the git add command. For example, to add all files, you can use:
csharp
Copy code
git add .
Commit Changes: Commit the changes to the repository with a descriptive message using the git commit command:
sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a Repository on GitHub: Go to the GitHub website and log in to your account. Then, click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository". Follow the instructions to create a new repository, and make sure not to initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license since you already have your project files.
Add Remote Repository: After creating the repository on GitHub, copy the repository URL. In Git Bash, add the remote repository using the following command:
csharp
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository-url>
Push to GitHub: Finally, push your changes to GitHub using the git push command:
perl
Copy code
git push -u origin master
Replace master with the name of the branch you want to push if you are not using the master branch.
That's it! Your files should now be deployed to GitHub. You can refresh the GitHub repository page to see your files online.
